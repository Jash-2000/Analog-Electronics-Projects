## To add new library in LTSpice XVII

  * Put the .lib file in C:\Users\username\Documents\LTspiceXVII\lib\sub
  * Put the .asy file in C:\Users\username\Documents\LTspiceXVII\lib\sym

**Note**: Version XVII reads its data from the ....../Documents/LTspiceXVII/ path when using Windows 10. Even if you have installed LTSpice at any other location, put the files
only at this location. If any instance of LTSpice was open during this time, restart to see the changes.
