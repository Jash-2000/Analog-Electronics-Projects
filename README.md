# Analog-Electronics-Projects
Various Projects done using LTSpice for fulfillment of Analog Electronics Course at BITS Pilani

**I was also the Teaching Assistant of this course, working under Dr. Anu Gupta. I have also added my final reports for the graded assignemnt developed for students ( only for reference).** The files are present in **TA Work** folder.

## To add new library in LTSpice XVII

  * Put the .lib file in C:\Users\username\Documents\LTspiceXVII\lib\sub
  * Put the .asy file in C:\Users\username\Documents\LTspiceXVII\lib\sym

**Note**: Version XVII reads its data from the ....../Documents/LTspiceXVII/ path when using Windows 10. Even if you have installed LTSpice at any other location, put the files
only at this location. If any instance of LTSpice was open during this time, restart to see the changes.
